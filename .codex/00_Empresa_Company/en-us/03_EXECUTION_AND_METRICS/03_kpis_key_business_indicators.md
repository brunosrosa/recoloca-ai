# KPIs and Key Business Indicators

## 1. Overview and Metrics Philosophy

Our approach to metrics is focused on **simplicity, actionability, and alignment**. Each KPI should be directly linked to a business objective and should be clear enough for the entire team to understand its importance and how they can impact it.

We prioritize **Metrics that Matter (North Star Metric)** over vanity metrics.

## 2. North Star Metric

*   **Definition:** The North Star Metric is the measure that best captures the core value we deliver to our customers.

| North Star Metric | Description | Rationale | Measurement Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`[Define the Metric]`** | `[Clear and concise description of the metric]` | `[Why does this metric represent the core value for the customer and business success?]` | `[Daily, Weekly, Monthly]` |
