# Business KPIs and Key Indicators

## 1. Overview and Metrics Philosophy

Our approach to metrics is focused on **simplicity, actionability, and alignment**. Each KPI should be directly linked to a business objective and should be clear enough for the entire team to understand its importance and how they can impact it.

We prioritize **Metrics that Matter (North Star Metric)** over vanity metrics.
