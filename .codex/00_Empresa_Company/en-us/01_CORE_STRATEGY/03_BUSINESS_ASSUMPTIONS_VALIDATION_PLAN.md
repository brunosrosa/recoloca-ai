# Business Assumptions Validation Plan

This document serves as a template to systematically validate the main business assumptions of a project or product before and during its development. The goal is to minimize product-market fit risks and maximize success chances, following a structured and evidence-based approach.

## Core Assumptions to Validate

### 1. Problem/Market Assumptions

#### P1: Real Pain of Target Audience
**Assumption**: Software architects and development teams face difficulties in keeping documentation of complex systems consistent, updated, and useful for both humans and AI systems.

**Specific Hypotheses**:
- H1.1: >60% of teams use a mix of wikis, text documents, and static diagrams, resulting in fragmented knowledge
- H1.2: >70% feel that documentation becomes obsolete quickly after creation
- H1.3: >50% would like documentation to be used to automate configuration and validation tasks
- H1.4: >80% consider the process of keeping documentation updated time-consuming and of low perceived value

#### P2: Willingness to Pay
**Assumption**: The target audience is willing to invest time in adopting an open-source framework that structures and governs their knowledge base.

#### P3: Market Size and Accessibility
**Assumption**: There is a global and accessible market of developers and companies that use Git and are open to "Docs-as-Code" practices.

### 2. Solution Assumptions

#### P4: Proposed Solution Adequacy
**Assumption**: The combination of **Structured Templates** + **Metadata Governance** + **Docs-as-Code Workflow** effectively solves the pains of documentation inconsistency and obsolescence.

#### P5: Usability and Adoption
**Assumption**: The framework is clear enough to be adopted by teams with Git knowledge, based on the provided documentation.

### 3. Business Model Assumptions

#### P6: Monetization Model Effectiveness
**Assumption**: The **Open-Source** model generates adoption and community contributions, creating future opportunities for consulting services and premium templates.

#### P7: Acquisition Channels
**Assumption**: We can attract users organically through quality content and the open-source nature of the project itself.

## Validation Methodology

### Phase 1: Pre-Development Validation
**Objective**: Validate **problem** and **market** assumptions before investing significant resources in development.

#### 1.1 Online Quantitative Research
- **Method**: Structured survey (questionnaire)
- **Sample**: [Number] of [Target Audience]
- **Channels**: LinkedIn, Online Communities, Email
- **Duration**: [Number] weeks

#### 1.2 Qualitative Interviews
- **Method**: Semi-structured interviews to deepen understanding
- **Sample**: [Number] of [Target Audience]
- **Duration**: [Time] minutes each
- **Format**: Video call, In-person

#### 1.3 Competitor and Market Analysis
- **Method**: Desk research and competitive analysis
- **Scope**: Direct and indirect solutions in national and global markets
- **Focus**: Pricing models, features, value proposition, user feedback

### Phase 2: Prototype Validation
**Objective**: Validate **solution** assumptions with a prototype (MVP, mockups, etc.).

#### 2.1 Usability Testing
- **Method**: Moderated or unmoderated usability tests
- **Sample**: [Number] users from target audience
- **Metrics**: Task completion rate, time to complete tasks, System Usability Scale (SUS)

#### 2.2 Value Proposition Test (Landing Page)
- **Method**: A/B or multivariate tests with different landing page versions
- **Metrics**: Conversion rate, time on page, CTA clicks

### Phase 3: Beta Validation
**Objective**: Validate **business model** assumptions with a functional product in a controlled environment.

#### 3.1 Closed Beta (or Pilot)
- **Sample**: [Number] selected users (early adopters)
- **Duration**: [Number] weeks
- **Focus**: Real usage behavior, engagement, detailed feedback collection

#### 3.2 Pricing Test
- **Method**: Present different price options to user groups
- **Metrics**: Price sensitivity analysis, purchase intention, conversion rate to paid plans

### Phase 4: Post-Launch Validation
**Objective**: Validate **growth** and **sustainability** assumptions at scale.

#### 4.1 Cohort Analysis
- **Focus**: Analyze behavior of user groups who started using the product in the same period
- **Metrics**: Retention, Lifetime Value (LTV), Churn patterns

#### 4.2 Channel Analysis
- **Focus**: Measure effectiveness and ROI of different acquisition channels
- **Metrics**: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) per channel, quality of acquired users

## Success Criteria

### Criteria to Proceed with Development
**Minimum 70% of Phase 1 hypotheses validated**

### Criteria for Beta Launch
**Minimum 80% of Phase 2 hypotheses validated**

### Criteria for Public Launch
**Minimum 75% of Phase 3 hypotheses validated**

### Criteria for Scaling
- Product-Market Fit Score >40% (Sean Ellis Test)
- NPS >50
- Monthly retention >60%
- CAC payback <6 months

## Tools and Resources

### Quantitative Research
- **Google Forms** or **Typeform** for surveys
- **LinkedIn** for distribution
- **Google Analytics** for tracking

### Qualitative Research
- **Calendly** for scheduling
- **Zoom** for interviews
- **Notion** or **Airtable** for data organization

### Data Analysis
- **PostHog** for product analytics
- **Google Analytics** for web analytics
- **Mixpanel** for event tracking (if needed)

### Usability Testing
- **Maze** or **UserTesting** for remote testing
- **Hotjar** for heatmaps and session recordings

## Contingency Plans

### If Problem Assumptions Don't Validate
- **Pivot target audience**: Expand to other professionals beyond IT
- **Refine value proposition**: Focus on more specific identified pains
- **Consider B2B**: Sell to companies instead of individuals

### If Solution Assumptions Don't Validate
- **Simplify product**: Focus only on most valued features
- **Improve UX**: Invest more in design and usability
- **Add features**: Based on specific feedback

### If Business Model Assumptions Don't Validate
- **Adjust prices**: Test different ranges
- **Change model**: Consider one-time payment or commission
- **Focus on volume**: Reduce prices to increase user base
