## 7. Critical Next Steps for Validation and Risk Mitigation

### 7.1. Technical Validation

1. **RLS Architecture Validation (FastAPI + Supabase):**
   - _Action:_ Create functional prototype validating Row-Level Security integration between FastAPI and Supabase, including authentication and authorization flows.
   - _Mitigated Risk:_ Unexpected complexity or infeasibility of authentication/authorization integration.

2. **API Cost Estimation (Gemini and Stripe) and Infrastructure (Supabase, Vercel/Render):**
   - _Action:_ Model usage scenarios (low, medium, high) to estimate monthly costs based on current API and service prices. Validate Freemium model sustainability.
   - _Mitigated Risk:_ Unfeasible or higher than expected operational costs.

3. **Product-Market Fit Validation (Prototype and Early Adopters):**
   - _Action:_ Create navigable prototype of main user journeys and conduct tests with 10-15 early adopters from target audience, measuring Sean Ellis PMF Score and qualitative feedback.
   - _Mitigated Risk:_ Low adoption or product-market inadequacy.

4. **PDF Parsing and Semantic Extraction Proof of Concept (PoC):**
   - _Action:_ Test `pymupdf` and `Tesseract OCR` with variety of resume layouts. Validate LLM (Gemini) capability to correctly categorize resume sections.
   - _Mitigated Risk:_ Difficulty processing resume format diversity, impacting optimization quality.

5. **Detailed Data Model Definition in Supabase:**
   - _Action:_ Based on FRs, detail database schema (tables, columns, relationships, data types, constraints) in Supabase.
   - _Mitigated Risk:_ Inconsistencies or lack of necessary data for functionalities.
