#### 1.2 API Endpoints

```python
# AI Coach endpoints
POST /api/coach/chat
GET /api/coach/conversations
GET /api/coach/conversations/{id}
POST /api/coach/feedback
GET /api/coach/progress
POST /api/coach/goals
```

### 2. Data Models

#### 2.1 Conversation Model

```python
class Conversation:
    id: UUID
    user_id: UUID
    title: str
    status: ConversationStatus
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

#### 2.2 Message Model

```python
class Message:
    id: UUID
    conversation_id: UUID
    role: MessageRole  # user, assistant, system
    content: str
    timestamp: datetime
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    tokens_used: int
```

#### 2.3 User Profile Model

```python
class CoachingProfile:
    user_id: UUID
    preferences: Dict[str, Any]
    goals: List[str]
    progress_metrics: Dict[str, float]
    coaching_style: str
    interaction_history: Dict[str, Any]
```

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### 1. LLM Provider Integration

**Supported Providers:**
- OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5
- Anthropic Claude
- Local models via Ollama

**Provider Abstraction:**
```python
class LLMProvider:
    def generate_response(self, messages: List[Message], context: str) -> str
    def estimate_tokens(self, text: str) -> int
    def get_model_info(self) -> ModelInfo
```

### 2. RAG System Integration

**Context Retrieval:**
- Semantic search for relevant information
- Dynamic context injection
- Source attribution and citations

**Knowledge Sources:**
- User documentation
- Best practices guides
- Domain-specific knowledge bases
