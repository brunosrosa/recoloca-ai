PUT /api/kanban/columns/{id}
DELETE /api/kanban/columns/{id}
```

### 2. Data Models

#### 2.1 Board Model

```python
class KanbanBoard:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    description: str
    project_id: UUID
    owner_id: UUID
    visibility: BoardVisibility
    settings: Dict[str, Any]
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

#### 2.2 Column Model

```python
class KanbanColumn:
    id: UUID
    board_id: UUID
    name: str
    position: int
    wip_limit: Optional[int]
    column_type: ColumnType  # backlog, active, done
    color: str
    settings: Dict[str, Any]
```

#### 2.3 Task Model

```python
class KanbanTask:
    id: UUID
    board_id: UUID
    column_id: UUID
    title: str
    description: str
    assignee_id: Optional[UUID]
    reporter_id: UUID
    priority: TaskPriority
    status: TaskStatus
    tags: List[str]
    due_date: Optional[datetime]
    estimated_hours: Optional[float]

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. Drag and Drop Interface

**Frontend Implementation:**
- HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- Touch support for mobile devices
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Collision detection and snap-to-grid

**Backend Validation:**
- Position calculation and validation
- WIP limit enforcement
- Workflow rule checking
- Concurrent update handling

### 2. Real-time Collaboration

**WebSocket Integration:**
- Real-time task updates
- User presence indicators
- Collaborative editing prevention
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

**Event Broadcasting:**
```python
class KanbanEvent:
    event_type: EventType  # task_moved, task_created, etc.
    board_id: UUID
    user_id: UUID
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime
```

### 3. Workflow Automation

**Business Rules Engine:**
