## 🎯 Language-Specific Checks

### Python/FastAPI Backend

#### Code Style and Structure
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] Type hints are used for function parameters and return values
- [ ] Docstrings follow Google or NumPy style
- [ ] Imports are organized (standard, third-party, local)
- [ ] Virtual environment dependencies are updated
- [ ] `__all__` is defined for public modules

#### FastAPI Specific
- [ ] Pydantic models are used for request/response validation
- [ ] Dependency injection is used appropriately
- [ ] API documentation is generated and accurate
- [ ] Response models are properly defined
- [ ] Background tasks are used for long-running operations
- [ ] Middleware is implemented correctly

#### Python Best Practices
```python
# Good: Type hints and clear function signature
def analyze_cv(cv_content: str, user_id: UUID) -> CVAnalysisResult:
    """Analyze CV content and return structured results.
    
    Args:
        cv_content: Raw text content of the CV
        user_id: ID of the user requesting analysis
        
    Returns:
        CVAnalysisResult with score and suggestions
        
    Raises:
        CVAnalysisError: If analysis fails
    """
    if not cv_content.strip():
        raise ValueError("CV content cannot be empty")
    
    try:
        # Analysis logic here
        return CVAnalysisResult(score=score, suggestions=suggestions)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"CV analysis failed for user {user_id}: {e}")
        raise CVAnalysisError("Analysis failed") from e

# Bad: No type hints, unclear function
def analyze(content):
    # Analysis logic
    return result
```

### TypeScript/React Frontend

#### Code Style and Structure
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode is enabled and followed
- [ ] Interfaces are used for object type definitions
- [ ] Components have proper prop type definitions
- [ ] Hooks are used correctly and follow rules of hooks
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configurations are followed
- [ ] Barrel exports are used for clean imports

#### React Best Practices
- [ ] Components are properly memoized when needed
- [ ] State is managed at appropriate levels
- [ ] Side effects are handled in useEffect
- [ ] Event handlers are properly bound
- [ ] Keys are used correctly in lists
- [ ] Accessibility attributes are included

#### TypeScript Examples
```typescript
// Good: Proper typing and error handling
interface CVUploadProps {
  onUploadComplete: (analysisId: string) => void;
  onError: (error: string) => void;
  maxFileSize?: number;
}

const CVUpload: React.FC<CVUploadProps> = ({ 
  onUploadComplete, 
  onError, 
  maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024 
}) => {
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleFileUpload = useCallback(async (file: File) => {
    if (file.size > maxFileSize) {
      onError('File size exceeds maximum limit');
      return;
    }
    
    setIsUploading(true);
    try {
      const result = await uploadCV(file);
      onUploadComplete(result.analysisId);
    } catch (error) {
      onError(error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Upload failed');
    } finally {
      setIsUploading(false);
    }
  }, [maxFileSize, onUploadComplete, onError]);
  
  return (
    <div className="cv-upload">
      {/* Upload UI */}
    </div>
  );
};

// Bad: No proper typing or error handling
const CVUpload = ({ onComplete }) => {
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleUpload = (file) => {
    setUploading(true);
    uploadCV(file).then(result => {
      onComplete(result.id);
      setUploading(false);
    });
  };
  
  return <div>{/* Upload UI */}</div>;
};
```
